# This is Git's per-user configuration file.
[user]

        email = mail@icemining.io
[url "git@github.com:"]

$ go get github.com/private/repo && echo Success!
Success!





An alternative to using git@github.com is to generate a personal access token on your GitHub account, grant it repo access, and then use the following instead:

git config --global url."https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}:x-oauth-basic@github.com/".insteadOf "https://github.com/"

That should still work with go get -u, and also works with Docker builds (my particular use case, and how I came across your gist).
